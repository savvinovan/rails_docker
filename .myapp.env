# This is how we'll connect to PostgreSQL. It's good practice to keep the

# Since we're dealing with development mode, it's ok to have a weak password
# such as `yourpassword` but in production you'll definitely want a better one.

# Eventually we'll be running everything in Docker containers, and you can set
# the host to be equal to `postgres` thanks to how Docker allows you to link
# containers.

# Everything else is standard Rails configuration for a PostgreSQL database.

# Both of these values are using the same Redis address but in a real

# which is why they are separated here.
#
# We'll be using the same Docker link trick for Redis which is how we can
# reference the Redis hostname as `redis`.
